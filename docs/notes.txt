I think the value field needs to be parsed very differently. Rather
than trying to impose meaning on the whole field, I should think about
the field as subfields, like source/target. I think the value looks
something like this, ALL of which are optional except for the base_value

block 1: applied values: base_value crit '~' eff_value
block 2: damage type: name {id}
block 3: mitigation ability: -name {id}
block 4: mitigation/reflection: '(' INT name {id} ')'

Due to bugs and other issues that I can't possibly fathom, blocks 2-4
have weird formats:

block 2: 'name' might be empty (missing), leaving only {id}

block 3: This might only be '-'

block 4: Either INT or 'name {id}' might be missing

Seems like I can find these blocks relatively easily:

block 1: Always present, find '~' for eff value

block 2: First character past block 1 is not '-' and not '('

block 3: Next character is '-'

block 4: Has '()' delimiters

Fuck me. If I go this route, it means:

1. I give up imposing much semantic meaning on these values. In other
   words, I give up trying to do much interpretation and become more
   dumb.
2. I have to ditch all of the Value types and just keep LogInfo and
   some other type that represents this bizarre union.
3. Rewrite tests, etc. Ugh.

Lunch.

First, let's review my fatal parses.

OK, all are either source or value. Makes sense - value is the only
truly complicated field and I've been f'ing around with the source
parsing. ::sigh::

There is a fatal parse error in a target! Let's find that.

Shit, the parsed file is so huge that I can't really work with
it. Need to write a python script to parse the timestamp and then
search assumiming it's sorted. :/

Even wc -l takes f'ing forever.

960,064,170

That's a lot of lines. Almost a million lilnes. Better do it in C++.

I feel like learning some coroutines so I can easily read from a file
in a for-each loop. This requires me to learn more of the
library. But, hey, why not? I have the time!

'co_return': Produce return value of a coro when the coroutine ends.

'co_await': suspend a co_routine until an await'ed condition is
satisfied.

'co_yield': produce a value to the caller and suspend.

"coroutine handle": pointer to coroutine state to continue or destroy.

"promise type": user-defined type that defines the return object of
the coroutine, the logic for handling suspension and resumption, and
how to handle exceptions.

"awaiter": An object that defines how to handle 'co_await' - must
implement await_ready(), await_suspend(), and await_resume().

Lifecycle:

- Creation: When coroutine function is first called, creates coroutine
  frame holding coroutine state.
- Initial suspension: At creation, coroutine starts but the promise
  type can tell it to immediately suspend before the first execution.
- Execution: coroutine executes user code until it encounters
  co_await, co_yield, or co_return.
- Suspension: Use awaiter's logic to determine how to suspend when
  code executes co_await or co_yield.
- Resumption: Coroutine can be resumed until another co_wait or
  co_yield is encountered.
- Final suspension: After the coroutine has completed, the promise
  determines if it should suspend again.
- Destruction: Coroutine frame is destroyed and releases all resources.

Simple example:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
#include <chrono>
#include <coroutine>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <thread>

struct simple_awaiter {
    std::chrono::milliseconds delay;

    auto await_ready() const noexcept -> bool {
	// Handles the case where the user wants no delay.
	return delay.count() <= 0;
    }

    auto await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) const -> void {
	std::thread([handle, this] {
	    // Simulate waiting for some event
	    std::this_thread::sleep_for(delay);
	    // Resume the coroutine after the delay
	    handle.resume();
	}).detach(); 
    }

    auto await_resume() const noexcept -> void {
	// Simply continue execution
    }
};

struct task {
    struct promise_type {
	auto get_return_object() -> task {
	    return {std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(*this)};
	}
	auto initial_suspend() -> std::suspend_never {
	    return {};
	}
	auto final_suspend() noexcept -> std::suspend_never {
	    return {};
	}
	auto return_void() -> void {
	}
	auto unhandled_exception() -> void {
	}
    };

    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> m_handle;
};

auto async_wait(std::chrono::milliseconds delay) ->task {
    std::cout << "Coroutine is about to suspend for " << delay.count() << "ms." << std::endl;
    co_await simple_awaiter {delay};
    std::cout << "Coroutine has resumed." << std::endl;
    co_return;
}

// Use 'endl' to force flushing.
auto main() -> int {
    std::cout << "main start---->" << std::endl;
    auto task = async_wait(std::chrono::seconds(5));
    std::cout << "main continues." << std::endl;
    // Ensure the coroutine has resumed: > 5s
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(7));
    std::cout << "main end <----\n";
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the cppreference:

Coroutine is a function that can suspend and resume without a stack -
they use a heap allocation to act as an execution frame. A coroutine
may contain the following keywords:

co_await: suspend execution until resumed

co_yield: suspend execution and yield a value to caller

co_return: complete execution and return value

Note that a coroutine must use co_return AND NOT return.

A coroutine shouldn't fall off the end (return void implicitly) - UB.

The 'main' function can't be a coroutine.

A coroutine is associated with:

- the COROUTINE PROMISE object: this is manipulated INSIDE the
  coroutine.  The coroutine submits its result (or an exception)
  through the promise object. This has nothing to do with
  std::promise.
- the COROUTINE HANDLE: this is manipulated OUTISDE the coroutine. A
  non-owning handle, this is used to resume execution of the coroutine
  or destroy the coroutine frame.
- the COROUTINE STATE: this is internal, dynamically-allocated
  storage. It contains:
  - the COROUTINE PROMISE object
  - the PARAMETERS passed by the caller to the coroutine - always
    copied by value.
  - some representation of the CURRENT SUSPENSION POINT (a co_yield
    statement) so that the coroutine can resume execution or know
    which locals are in scope.
  - LOCAL VARIABLES that are active at the suspension point - their
    lifetime spans the suspension point

The coroutine state is basically an execution frame that's implemented
using the heap rather than the stack. This allows the coroutine's
execution to transcend the stack and have a lifetime past the single
execution of a function.

When a coroutine BEGINS execution, it performs these steps:

1. ALLOCATES the COROUTINE STATE OBJECT (execution frame) using
   operator new. NOTE: The dynamic allocation can be avoided in
   certain conditions, see below.
2. COPIES all FUNCTION PARAMETERS into the coroutine state. Note that
   ref parameters will be references in the coroutine state (not
   copies), meaning the references can dangle because the coroutine's
   lifespan may be longer than the variable referenced by the
   parameter... OOPS.
3. Calls the CONSTRUCTOR of the PROMISE OBJECT. The promise object's
   constructor can take the same arguments as the coroutine
   parameters OR it can be the default constructor.
4. Calls PROMISE.GET_RETURN_OBJECT() and stores result in a local
   variable. This will be returned to the caller when the coroutine
   suspends for the first time. Stuff about exceptions...
5. Calls PROMISE.INITIAL_SUSPEND() and CO_AWAITs for its
   result. Typical coroutine Promise types either return
   std::suspend_always if they want to be "lazy," meaning they just
   prepare now but do no work until some later time; or, they can
   return std::suspend_never, meaning they are eager and want to
   immediately begin running now.
6. When CO_AWAIT PROMISE.INITIAL_SUSPEND() resumes, start executing
   the body of the coroutine.

When a coroutine REACHES A SUSPENSION POINT (co_yield?), the return
object (created by PROMISE.GET_RETURN_OBJECT() when a coroutine
starts) is returned to the user after any implicit conversion to the
coroutine's return type.

When a coroutine REACHES CO_RETURN (the end of the coroutine), the
following happens:

1. Calls PROMISE.RETURN_VOID() for a NAKED CO_RETURN or co_return
   expression that is void.
2. Calls PROMISE.RETURN_VALUE() for a CO_RETURN that has a non-void
   expression.
3. DESTROYS ALL VARIABLES with automatic storage duration IN REVERSE
   ORDER.
4. Calls PROMISE.FINAL_SUSPEND() and CO_AWAITs the result

Stuff about exceptions.

The COROUTINE STATE can be destroyed because:

- the coroutine terminates via CO_RETURN
- the coroutine terminates because the CALLER DESTROYED IT using the
  COROUTINE HANDLE
- an UNHANDLED EXCEPTION occured in the coroutine function

When the coroutine state is destroyed, it does:

1. calls the PROMISE OBJECT'S DESTRUCTOR
2. calls the DESTRUCTORS of each of the COROUTINE FUNCTION'S PARAMETERS
3. calls OPERATOR DELETE to clean up the COROUTINE'S STATE
4. transfers execution back to the caller

The COROUTINE FUNCTION can be either a FREE FUNCTION or a MEMBER FUNCTION.

For a FREE FUNCTION as the coroutine function, the COROUTINE type is

task<void> foo(int x);

then it's PROMISE type will be

std::coroutine_traits<task<void>, int>::promise_type;

For a MEMBER FUNCTION as the coroutine function, the COROUTINE type
is

task<void> Bar::foo(int x);

then its PROMISE type will be

std::coroutine_traits<task<void>, Bar&, int>::promise_type;

* CO_AWAIT <expr>

The unary operator CO_AWAIT suspends the coroutine and returns control
to the caller.

1. The expression is converted to an AWAITABLE. The awaitable can
   either be the result of the expression OR, if the PROMISE type has
   a member function named AWAIT_TRANSFORM, then the awaitable object
   is produced by calling PROMISE.AWAIT_TRANSFORM(EXPR).
2. The AWAITER object is obtained by:
   - If there is a CO_AWAIT() operator function that's the best match,
     then use either the free function OPERATOR CO_AWAIT or the member
     function on the AWAITABLE object, AWAITABLE.OPERATOR CO_AWAIT()
     and use the return as the AWAITER object.
   - Otherwise, the AWAITER and the AWAITABLE are the same.
3. AWAITER.AWAIT_READY() is called, which allows the coroutine to
   either immdiately run if the return is true or suspend if the
   return is false. This allows the coroutine to avoid an unnecessary
   suspension if it can produce the result immediately.

If awaiter.await_ready() returns false, this tells the coroutine to
suspend and the following happens:

1. The COROUTINE STATE IS POPULATED with coroutine's active local
   variables and what's required to restart at the current suspension
   point.
2. AWAITER.AWAIT_SUSPEND(HANDLE) is called where HANDLE represents the
   current coroutine. await_suspend() can examine the coroutine state
   via handle. await_suspend() is RESPONSIBLE to SCHEDULE RESUMPTION
   via some executo. AWAIT_SUSPEND can return either VOID or BOOL.
3. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() returns VOID, then the coroutine remains
   suspended and control immediately returns to the caller.
4. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() returns BOOL, if:
   - TRUE: return control to the caller/resumer of the current coroutine.
   - FALSE: resume the current coroutine
5. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() returns a COROUTINE HANDLE for a DIFFERENT
   COROUTINE, that coroutine is resumed via HANDLE.RESUME().
6. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() THROWS an exception...
7. AWAITER.AWAIT_RESUME() is called (whether or not the coroutine is
   actually suspended). awaiter.await_resume()'s return value is the
   value of the co_await expression.

NOTES:

Examples look like the coroutine returns a coroutine handle to the
caller. God, I don't understand this.

* CO_YIELD:

CO_YIELD <expr> returns the result of 'expr' to the caller and then
suspends the current coroutine. It is "the common building block of
resumable generator functions."

co_yield expr;

is equivalent to

co_await promise.yield_value(expr);

Huh.

A typical generator's YIELD_VALUE stores its argument into the
generator object and return std::suspend_always, causing the coroutine
to suspend and return control to the caller/resumer.

The dox say nothing about co_return. Hmm.

So, if I want to create a generator for reading a file, such that is
looks like this:

y = std::ifstream(file);
x = coro(y);

for (auto line : x) {
    // do something with 'line'
}

How would I go about that?

Huh, cppreference coroutine_handle has an example!

Sweet, I used the example in cppreference with a little function of my
own to make a file reader that works in a range for loop. Nice.

OK, so how do I do this?

Trying to 'createdb' (per Postgres documentation), but getting an
error:

$ createdb: error: database creation failed: ERROR:  permission denied to create database

The tutorial indicates that I need to log into the account that's
associated with the postgres server. Can't seem to do that. I found a
user named 'postgres', but I don't know the password!

$ su postgres
Password: 
su: Authentication failure

Tried my favorite and some other obvious ones, like:

admin
administrator
postgres
postgresql
jason

I think I installed it as part of the SQL class, but I can't remember
much about that. Let's go look.

Huh, the notes from the postgres class look like this:

$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Start the service running:

$ sudo systemctl start postgresql.service

Become the postgres user to avoid having to authenticate with the
database as the superuser:

$ sudo -i -u postgres

Access the command-line client:

$ psql

Now I can make my user and database:

CREATE USER jason WITH PASSWORD 'jason';
CREATE DATABASE people WITH OWNER 'jason';

Now get out of sudo and connect directly:

$ psql people jason
psql (16.3 (Ubuntu 16.3-0ubuntu0.24.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

people=>

OK, that all seems reasonable. However, I'm guessing in order to use
createdb I'll have to specify my user name somehow. Let's see.

Yeah, createdb can specify the username:

-U, --username  user name to connect as
-W, --password  force password prompt

$ createdb -WU jason
Password: (entered jason)
createdb: error: database creation failed: ERROR:  permission denied to create database

So, still no joy. Let's try the suggestion from the class:

$ sudo -i -u postgres
[sudo] password for jason: 
postgres@jason-ThinkPad-T580:~$ 

OK, so now I'm the postgres user.

postgres@jason-ThinkPad-T580:~$ psql
psql (16.9 (Ubuntu 16.9-0ubuntu0.24.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# SELECT * from USER;
   user   
----------
 postgres
(1 row)

There's no 'jason' user like I expected? I wonder if I didn't actually
do that.

postgres=# CREATE USER jason WITH PASSWORD 'jason';
ERROR:  role "jason" already exists

Huh. So, it's a role and not in the USER table?

Ah, there's a super-secret command that I found via:

postgres=# \?

\dg shows the roles

                             List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes                         
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------
 jason     | 
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS

Huh. Notice that 'jason' doesn't have any attributes, so it literally
can't create databases. Ah-ha!

Per the web:

postgres=# ALTER ROLE jason WITH CREATEDB;
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# \dg
                             List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes

 Excellent. Trying via createdb again.

$ createdb -WU jason

jason=> 

Looks good. Now, how do I set the current database?

jason=> \c swtor_combat_explorer
You are now connected to database "swtor_combat_explorer" as user "jason".
swtor_combat_explorer=> 

OK, sweet. Notice that "database" and "schema" seemed to be used
interchangably. Now let's create our first table!

swtor_combat_explorer=> CREATE TABLE Name (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR (128),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
swtor_combat_explorer->

Seemed to work. Actually, I hadn't finished the command yet! See the
prompt went from => to -> (equals to dash). This means that I haven't
completed the command. Let's try again.

swtor_combat_explorer=> CREATE TABLE Name (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR (128),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE
swtor_combat_explorer=>

Better.

swtor_combat_explorer=> \dt
       List of relations

swtor_combat_explorer=> 

OK, I like it. How do I show the schema of a table?

Note that Postgres doesn't seem to preserve capitalization - the
relation is "name" not "Name" like I entered. Hmm.

swtor_combat_explorer=> \d name
                       Table "public.name"
 Column |          Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default

    "name_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

swtor_combat_explorer=> 

So, this just relates a numeric ID to a string. ez-pz.

Next table.

swtor_combat_explorer=> CREATE TABLE Combat_Style (
  id SERIAL,
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);
CREATE TABLE
swtor_combat_explorer=>

And how does it look?

swtor_combat_explorer=> \d combat_style
                            Table "public.combat_style"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable |                 Default

Indexes:
    "combat_style_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "combat_style_name_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES name(id)

swtor_combat_explorer=>

Nice. The 'nextval' stuff is the internal junk that implements a
monotonically-increasing sequence suitable for an identifier (SERIAL).

2025-08-13

OK, I think the parsing task is pretty much done. I can go through
hundreds of logs with gigabytes of data and not encounter a single
parsing failure. Of course, I've also given up on some of the
higher-level semantic extraction I was trying to embed. No matter,
probably better left to client code anyway.

Now I want to think about how to store this data in a database. Need
to think about tables and fields now. Joy. SQL. Suck.

Obvious tables:

CREATE TABLE Version (
  id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  creation TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- All of the names we've seen so far
--
-- This is an optimization to avoid storing strings in multiple tables.
-- The 'id' field is directly from the input log entry and is guaranteed
-- unique but is essentially a GUID.
CREATE TABLE Name (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR (128),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Because the Name primary key is a BIGINT, all FKs to it must also
-- be FKs.

-- These little tables that are really just FKs into Name are giving
-- semantic meaning to the Name. We could also add an enumeration column
-- to Name indicating the context for Name. I'm not sure if that's a
-- better idea. But, the enumeration does mean I'd have to update the
-- enumeration each time I wanted to add a new category of meaning,
-- whereas this just requires adding a table. Hmm.
CREATE TABLE Combat_Style (
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (name),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Advanced_Class (
  id SERIAL,
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  style INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (style) REFERENCES Combat_Style(name)
);

CREATE TABLE Actor (
  id SERIAL,
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

-- Because PC's can change their class, we need another identifier to
-- refer to the specific style/class used in a combat.

-- NOTE: Initially I thought I could use the inherited 'id' column from
-- Actor to be the primary key, but I had to list the 'id' directly in
-- 'PC' to allow me to refer to it from Companion. Postgres says this:
--
-- NOTICE:  merging column "id" with inherited definition
CREATE TABLE PC (
  id SERIAL,
  class INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (class) REFERENCES Advanced_Class(id)
) INHERITS (Actor);

CREATE TABLE Companion (
  id SERIAL,
  pc INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (pc) REFERENCES PC(id)
) INHERITS (Actor);

CREATE TABLE NPC (
  id SERIAL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) INHERITS (Actor);

CREATE TABLE Area (
--  id SERIAL,
  area INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (area),
  FOREIGN KEY (area) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Log_File (
  id SERIAL,
  filename VARCHAR(512),
  ts BIGINT NOT NULL, -- timestamp, ms past the epoch
  fully_parsed BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE Combat (
  id SERIAL,
  -- timestamps (ts_*) are stored as ms past the epoch
  ts_begin BIGINT NOT NULL,
  ts_end BIGINT NOT NULL,
  area INT NOT NULL,
  logfile INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (area) REFERENCES Area(area),
  FOREIGN KEY (logfile) REFERENCES Log_File(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Combat_Actor (
  combat INT NOT NULL,
  actor INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (combat, actor),
  FOREIGN KEY (combat) REFERENCES Combat(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (actor) REFERENCES Actor(id)
);

CREATE TYPE Location AS (
  x FLOAT,
  y FLOAT,
  z FLOAT,
  rot FLOAT
);

CREATE TYPE Health AS (
  current INT,
  maximum INT
);

CREATE TABLE Event (
  id SERIAL,
  ts BIGINT NOT NULL, -- ms since epoch
  source INT,
  source_location Location,
  source_health Health,
  target INT,
  target_location Location,
  target_health Health,
  ability INT,
  action_noun INT NOT NULL,
  action_verb INT NOT NULL,
  action_details INT,
  value_version VARCHAR(16),
  value_base INT,
  value_crit BOOL,
  value_effective INT,
  value_type INT,
  value_mitigation_reason INT,
  value_mitigation_effect_value INT,
  value_mitigation_effect_value_name INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (source) REFERENCES Actor(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (target) REFERENCES Actor(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (ability) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (action_noun) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (action_verb) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (action_details) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_type) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_mitigation_reason) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_mitigation_effect_value_name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

This seems like a reasonable first approximation. I'm not sure how to
exactly use the Actor hierarchy, but the inheritance hierarchy matches
how I think about it.

Gotta work on creating the database in Postgres and then try parsing
and inserting rows. Querying... that's something else. :)

2025-08-16

Brahms day! But a few database things as well. Probably should use the
environment variables for connecting/authenticating to the database.

PGDATABASE=swtor_combat_explorer
PGUSER=jason
PGPASSWORD=jason

Gotta get ready.

2025-08-17

Brahms was awesome.

Time to add pg to the CMake file and create a new executable to interact with pg and the parser library.

Tryuing to use libpqxx, a C++ API that sits on top of libpq, the standard C-client interface. Not working,
however. Installed libpqxx-dev and libpq-dev and then modified CMake per suggestion.

However, doesn't work because because libpqxx looks for std::source_location for some reason but c++20 doesn't have it -
my code is c++20. So, gonna switch over to fetchcontent.

OK, got it going. Looking good. Runs and I can connect to the DB. Let's see if I can query the version table, which
should have a row.

Got it! It works! Yay.

2025-08-23

pqxx::work is just an alias for pqxx::transaction<>. Too bad that's not documented anywhere.

2025-09-04

Yeah, lots of time has gone by. Getting more familiar with pqxx, lots of of learning and failing. :/

IMPORTANT: In SELECT statements, DON'T surround the result column list in '()'! This causes pqxx to NOT PARSE THE
RESULT. So, you just get a single column back and it's only useful as null-terminated string. Ugh, that cost me days of
pain.

Turns out more info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55320143/do-you-need-surrounding-parantheses-in-postgres-select-statement

So, if you put the parens in there, you're indicating you want a composite value value in a single column. The parens
form a "row constructor or "composite value." I was getting back a row with one column of a "row" type. I had no idea
had to deal with that.

After futzing around

2025-09-06

OK, finally getting on a roll. I think I have a better handle on pqxx and PostgreSql.

NOTE: Don't try to insert a value into a SERIAL field. I don't think the database knows to update the "get next value"
so eventually i think we get a clash.

I'm actually finding bugs with these tests, yay yay yay.

2025-09-10

Making good progress, but slowed by my stupid car problems. :/

2025-09-13

Stupid car problems, choir party - yesterday was fun, actually. No programming though. Today I'm back at it. Finished
add_pc_class and writing the test. Getting a weird error:

unknown file: Failure
C++ exception with description "ERROR:  input of anonymous composite types is not implemented
CONTEXT:  unnamed portal parameter $2 = '...'
" thrown in the test body.

After finding it and wrapping with a catch and rethrowing, I see this:

OOPS1
ERROR:  input of anonymous composite types is not implemented
CONTEXT:  unnamed portal parameter $2 = '...'

SELECT id FROM Advanced_class WHERE (style, advanced_class) = ($1, $2)
unknown file: Failure
C++ exception with description "ERROR:  input of anonymous composite types is not implemented
CONTEXT:  unnamed portal parameter $2 = '...'
" thrown in the test body.

2025-09-22

Car problems worked out, yay. A lot (lot lot) of time on add PC Actor function and its tests. I feel like I'm
overthinking this and that's why it's so complicated. Every log seems to start with

AreaEntered
DisciplineChanged

So, it's only for the first line that I won't know the class. You can't change class during combat so all I really need
to handle is remembering the actor row id of the last time I saw the pc. When combat starts I could even just search for
the most recent actor row that has the PC's name. Easy enough.

I'm seriously making this more complicated than it needs to be. :/ I'm pretty sure that all I need to remember is the
most recent actor row ID of the actor's name. But... maybe not. It looks like the logs DO have instances where the first
thing I see of a PC is NOT their class. :/ Rats!!

So I think I'll keep it simpl and use m_pcs and just update it when a new row is created in Actor.

2025-09-26

One possibility - We could flatten the text event into a single csv row with empty fields. Make it super easy to
parse. Like an intermediate representation. Another output like the database. Advantage: easier to read. Disadvantage -
more code to maintain. Advantage - other programs could work with this text more easily than interacting with the
database, which requires Postgres, blah blh blah. Disadvantage: reading csv might be slower and client would still have
to keep track of actors. But not a huge deal.

Wouldn't depend on a library, either, could do all csv parsing by hand since no string in the log can ever contain a
comma. Hmm.

2025-09-27

OK, spend some time to avoid running clang-tidy all over again.

2025-10-01

OMG, I think I just got rid of clang-tidy for all time. Well, I didn't see it running in a build.  So much faster. Let's
try changing just one file.

One problem of using the language server, of course, is that it runs clang-tidy, too.

No, I still see tidy being run. AARGH. Where? Why? ::sigh::

Wait. How could I possibly reparse the same log? How I would I know lines had been parsed and populated and which
hadn't? I'd have to search every line for the same timestamp and some other unique combination of attributes to see if
it existed. If this doesn't work right, I'd end up repopulating the entire file again, essentially blowing up the Event
table with duplicated garbage. Ugh.

OK, that's a problem for another time. But it will need to be solved. Easiest way seems to be by adding a logfile
attribute to Event. Then when a reparse was requested, we'd just blow everything, all events and combats and combat
actors related to that logfile and then reparse from scratch. I like that.

Dammit, so many things to do. :/

2025-10-13

Things are apace. Almost done with the db parser. I was able to create ParsedLogLine and have it populate an Event and
all of the vairous sub-tables. Yay.

I think I should rename the advanced_class table to be more up with the current nomenclature.

Interestingly, the game and the documentation is schizophrenic. The website talks about the old "class" and "advanced
class" terms, but the game itself talks about "Combat Style" and "Discipline." And the log talks about "Discipline
Changed" and doesn't use "class/advanced class" anywhere. Joy.

I think the table should be "Class" and the attributes should be "style" and "discipline." Makes it easier to get a
handle on it, IMHO.

I also created a new table that holds an ability name and a reference to a class. The ability is intended to be a unique
ability only available to the associated class. This will allow the DB to store a PC's class even if we never see a
DisciplineChanged event, which is common in some situations, like PvP or world activities, where not everybody's grouped
up.

In addition, I want to prepopulate the Class (was Advanced_Class) table with the current style/disciplines for PCs. No
reason to populate this table from the log. Just gotta do it.

Oh, I just removed clang-tidy entirely from the build. It was so slow and I get tidy from the lsp, so not a big
deal. IT'S SO MUCH FASTER NOW.

I'm gonna try parsing an entire log soon!! Yikes!! Then I gotta work on some searches to find interesting things... heh
heh heh.

Should I add a Logfile attribute to the Event table? That way you can always relate a log entry to the logfile it came
from and vice-versa. Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I have the logfile attribute in the Combat table, but there are a
lot of log entries that fall outside of combat, and those currently can't be related to a specific logfile.

But... does that matter? I'm not sure it does. The only reason we care about logfile even now is that we can keep track
of its parsing status via the "fully_parsed" attribute. Theoretically, once a logfile is fully parsed we can just ignore
a request to parse it again and save a ton of time.

In the end, I don't think it's worth doing anything to Event. Let's leave it the way it is. Who knows if this will even
be relevant in the end.

The db populator executable needs a lot of work. I haven't touched it in over a month since I moved the population code
into its own library.

2025-10-25

Fuck, the logfile is in CP-1252 (WINDOWS-1252) encoding and the database uses UTF-8 by default. Fuck fuck.

Use SET client_encoding = WIN1252; after creating database. Oops, didn't work. Still same error.

Want entire DB to be WIN1252.

FUCK ME.

create database swtor_combat_explorer with encoding 'WIN1252' LC_COLLATE='en_US.WIN1252' LC_CTYPE='en_US.WIN1252' TEMPLATE=template0;

Didn't work.

create database swtor_combat_explorer with encoding 'WIN1252' LC_COLLATE='C' LC_CTYPE='C' TEMPLATE=template0;

This seemed to have worked.

2025-10-27

Turns out you can have two ExitCombats in a row!

File: combat_2025-03-22_17_47_15_992759.txt

93027 and 93062

No intervening EnterCombat. Weird.

There's only 500ms or so between these lines.

It looks like it ends when I die and then it ends again when the final boss dies. Hmm.

Populator can't handle that and crashed. What should we do in that situation?

...43.720: ExitCombat
...43.805: Boss dies
...44.215: ExitCombat

Nobody died in-between or immediately. I dunno what happened. I'll log an error and ignore it.

Going to try Google's "gflags" library for command line parsing. Who knows?

Can't get it to build via FetchContent. Getting this error:

CMake Error (dev) at build/dev/_deps/gflags-src/CMakeLists.txt:430 (gflags_define):
  uninitialized variable 'LIB_SUFFIX'

Tried running ccmake in the gflags dir and 'c' for configure and then try to generate via cmake - no joy.

Had to set LIB_SUFFIX in gflag's CMakeLists.txt. Also had to update the required min version to 3.5 due to
deprecation. Sheeh. Ugh, also had to fix a floating comparison in a test I don't care about in gflags. Ugh.



2025-10-30

Added logic to specify how to handle populating logfiles that have already been parsed and pushed into the
database. That's kind of nice.

Added profiling via gprof to my code in the CMakeLists.txt like so:

target_compile_options(
  swtor_combat_populate_db_exe
  PRIVATE -pg
)

target_link_options(
  swtor_combat_populate_db_exe
  PRIVATE -pg
)

Now I'm running the populator (which also exercises the parser) against some logfiles. No idea what this will look
like. This will produce gmon.out.

We get an analysis via

gprof swtor_combate_populate_db_exe gmon.out > analysis.txt

Note that I tried gprofng, but it doesn't actually hack up the executable and just samples (somehow) the state of the
execution and uses that to infer timing, but that didn't seem very useful at all to me. Nice that it didn't require
recompilation and a big slow-down, but not much actual data.

To think about:

1) Start pushing up to GitHub.
2) Make a container for the build environment.
3) Add CI/CD via github actions.
4) Start using github for doing PRs, etc.
5) Analyze gprof results
6) Performance optimizations, if necessary.

OK, run finally finished. Around 330k log lines parsed and populated.

Highest cost of my calls:

DbPopulator::populate_from_entry - makes sense, this wraps all other populateion calls
DbPopulator::add_name_id - as I expected, this is the most expensive because it's called so often
    in fact, it's called 1,309,195 times for 330k entries. Wow, that's a lot. Easy to optimize via cache.
DbPopulator::add_action - not surprising, called on every single event. Easy enough to cache this, too.

Learned how to visualize using gprof2dot. Via:

gprof build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db gmon.out | gprof2dot --strip | dot -Tpng -o gprof.png

Very handy. '--strip' gets rid of all the cruft (function params, template shit, etc.). Very nice. Basically told me the
same thing but the callgraph is nice.

Also a recommendation to use 'callgrind' from valgrind instead of gprof. Not sure how callgrind works. Maybe look that
up.

But, the result I see from here is that adding the Name and Action cache would be handy.

Bedtime.

2025-10-31

Trying to push to github, but no luck. So, github account is "jbtiller". email is jtiller@fastmail.fm.

I didn't have any ssh keys. Created a key, github_jtiller_fastmail_fm_jbtiller_ed25519, and added to github. Still no
love.

I can test it with ssh via

ssh -T git@github.com -i ~/.ssh/github_jtiller_fastmail_fm_jbtiller_ed25519

which worked. But not connected to git yet.

Can't find anyway on git command line 'push' to specify which key to use.

Added config in ~/.ssh:

Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_jtiller_fastmail_fm_jbtiller_ed25519

Made sure ~/.ssh/config had 600 perms.

Now it's telling me this:

hostkeys_find_by_key_hostfile: hostkeys_foreach failed for /home/jason/.ssh/known_hosts: Permission denied
The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.116.4)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 

I say "yes" and it w3orks!

TODO: Rebuilt with profiling enabled. Run against some logfiles (copy exact command line here). Then store results in a
subdirectory. Then we can do some local caching (add_name_and_id, add_action, etc.) and see how things change.

2025-11-01

Made a psql script to create the database. Script is makedb.txt. To use:

$ psql -f makedb.txt

(This assumes a bunch of things, like PostgreSQL is installed, you have an account associated with the current user,
etc. etc.)

Let's try to flesh out the command-line searcher I started last week.

Ooh, created an issue. I love issues. I think I can link the branch to the issue? Not sure how. Oh, you'd create the
branch, then create a PR for it and then link that PR to the issue. I can also just create the branch from the issue
page and pull to get it.

That worked well and gives me a consistent naming scheme between the branch and the issue. Good.

Time for lunch.

Going to do a run with profiling enabled on this log file:

test/logs/combat_2025-05-07_19_07_03_273505.txt

$ wc -l test/logs/combat_2025-05-07_19_07_03_273505.txt

2025-11-02

Leftover from yesterday:

Going to do a run with profiling enabled on this log file:

test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt

$ wc -l test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt

56

$ BL_LEVEL=warning ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt >& populate.out

$ wc -l populate.out
populate.out 336457

swtor_combat_explorer=> select count(*) from event;
 count  
--------
 336290

Matches perfectly with # of lines in the raw event log. yay.

Why are there more lines in populate.out than rows in the event table?

$ grep -v "Parsing log line" populate.out | wc -l
167

All I see in these lines are "Did not encounter a double character. Skipping." Hmm.

So, no other errors or warnings. Nice. And this ONLY happens in the "AreaEntered" action that includes the two sentinels
(he3001) and <v7.0.0b>. Must be the second, since this can be parsed as a double. Let's see. Yeah, not gonna fix
that. No reason - very simple and occurs infrequently.

Initial timestamp in populate.out:

14:20:54.437478

Final timestamp in populate.out:

15:11:18.752620

About 50m 22s (3022s) for 336290 records. Or, a rough estimate of parsing/population time per event:

0.008s

Ooh, 8ms per event - that's f'ing slow.

swtor_combat_explorer=> select count(*) from event;
 count  
--------
 336290

Matches perfectly with # of lines in the raw event log. yay.

Here's how we redirect the psql REPL output to a file:

swtor_combat_explorer=> \o populate_events.txt
swtor_combat_explorer=> select * from event order by ts;
swtor_combat_explorer=> \o

The "\o file" turns on redirection in the psql REPL and then empty "\o" turns it off. Handy.

Let's rebuild with profiling off and try again.

OK, rebuilt and re-run.

$ BL_LEVEL=warning ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt >& populate.out

Interesting question: How many DB transactions do I make? Let's could these up. Huh, I don't see how to do it. :/

OK, some non-profiling results:

First entry timestamp:

15:25:45.962758

Last entry timestamp:

16:17:59.882762

Took about 52m 14s

That makes no sense - it's *slower* than with profiling on. Fuck that.

Oh, well, let's get back to the searching stuff.

OK, got the PCs in combat working. But... I have a problem. The combat is showing just the area name, like "R-4 anomaly"
and nothing more. I think I need to add some more info to the populator so it shows the boss in the Combat table. Hmm.

So, what would this need?

When we first enter combat, we have the area only but not the boss.

Well, I'd need a list of the names of bosses and then when I encounter the boss during combat, add that boss to the
combat entry.

So, just make a list of bosses and put that in another database table?

Too much for for now. Make a TODO.

Let's lookat more searches. Issue has info:

    Show all abilities on a per-class basis
    Given a combat ID and a PC ID, show all the abilities used by that PC in that combat
    Show all classes
    Show a count of the number of combats in each area

Getting there. I have these so far:

DEFINE_bool(all_actions,         false, "Show all actions");
DEFINE_bool(all_action_verbs,    false, "Show just the unique verbs in actions");
DEFINE_bool(all_class_abilities, false, "Show all abilities per class");
DEFINE_bool(all_classes,         false, "Show all classes");
DEFINE_bool(all_combats,         false, "Show all combats");
DEFINE_bool(pcs_in_combats,      false, "Show all PCs in all combats");

More to do, but that's a start.

I'm not thrilled with gflags. It feels pretty old and unmaintained and clunky. I also really don't like the usage
format. What's boost::options up to?

2025-11-03

OK, created a ticket for doing some performance profiling. Let's build with profiling on:

$ ccmake build/dev

Turn ENABLE_PROFILING ON

Then 'c' to configure and 'g' to generate.

$ cmake --build --prest=dev

Here's where we are:

c775b8b (HEAD -> 3-explore-local-caching-to-speed-up-population, ...)

To detect that an executable has been built against gprof, the internet recommends searching the symbols for
'mcount'. Here's what I see:

$ readelf -sWC build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db | grep mcount
   121: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND mcount@GLIBC_2.2.5 (5)
  4263: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND mcount@GLIBC_2.2.5

-s: Show symbols
-W: Allow the output to exeed 80 characters
-C: Demangle symbols

So, yes, we did link in profiling.

Let's do a fresh run.

$ psql -f makedb.txt

$ ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt >& populate_profiling_on_c775b8b.txt

Oh, CRAP. Didn't change the log level, so it's taking a looooong time.

Let's turn off logging entirely:

$ BL_LEVEL=fatal ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt >& populate_profiling_on_c775b8b.txt

OK, it's going. Wait, I want to time the run externally.

$ psql -f makedb.txt

$ BL_LEVEL=fatal time ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt >& populate_profiling_on_c775b8b.txt

Generate a gprof analysis:

$ gprof ../build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db gmon_c775b8b.out > gprof_analysis_c775b8b.txt

Let's look at the analysis:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.

Most calls: get_next_field 12 million times. Holy crap. Took up 0.4%

'time' said it toopk 48:43.76s for the entire run.

Let's look at the gprof2dot analysis:

$ gprof build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db gmon.out | gprof2dot --strip | dot -Tpng -o gprof.png

Some interesting takeaways from the dependency graph:

1. pqxx query01 takes 4.89% of the time.
2. The DbPopulator constructor took 9.25% of the time? What??
3. _fini (shutdown) took 9% of the time? These numbers can't be right.

I don't understand that - almost nothing in the populators. Most of them aren't even listed.

Dammit, something's not right. Fuck this. Gonna add my own shitty profiler.

OK, added class that captures time on entry and exit from a function. Then output in the top-level populator and I see this:

$ BL_LEVEL=fatal time ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt

Oh, I limited the number of line we process to 10k to make my life easier.

Geez, really, 371ms per call? We can do better than that, I bet. First, a cheesy implementation.

Note that the sum of all calls is 14.87s, or about a 4th of the entire time. Is that right?

OK, let's rebuild without profiling and see how we do.

$ ccmake build/dev
c then e then g

$ cmake --build --preset=dev && ctest --preset=dev

$ readelf -sWC build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db | grep mcount | wc -l

Hmm, 6 minutes faster.

Added some caching. Just a simple std::map that maps name UUIDs to Name row IDs. Let's see how this does.

First a run without profiling but with my dumb measurement in place.

$ psql -f makedb.txt

Yes, we just reduced the time by a factor of more than 10x. That's a win. :)

10001 events...

275 events per second. That's a helluva lot better!!

There are around 4 add_name_id() calls per event row. That's quite nice.

Let's take off the 10,000 record limiter and do the entire file. Here we go! Should take around 1,221 seconds, or 20 minutes.

Took off about 5 minutes, or around 1/9 (11.1%) of the total runtime. That's not bad. But not great. How can I do better?

2025-11-04

OK, I see these results after caching Name accesses in add_name_id using the first 10,001 log entries:

Let's add another measurement. Let's measure the amount of time we spend in parsing the event and the amount of time we
spend populating the database. Let's do 20k rows this time.

OK, added measurements around the parser's parse_line() entrypoint and the populator's populate_from_entry()
entrypoint. Here's what I see.

$ BL_LEVEL=fatal time ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt

So:

add_name_id:            16.5 us/call
parse_line:            208.9 us/call
populate_from_entry: 3,400.2 us/call

Wow.

Where is that time going? More measurements.

Ooh. add_pc_class is slow. Best thing about it is it doesn't use add_name_id at all. Bad thing is that it's not called
very often. :/ We can cache that!

Key type will need to be a tuple.

After caching add_pc_class:

About a 10x speedup. So, we have:

add_pc_class:
  -caching: 1,454.14us/call
  +caching: 142.2us/call

total:
  -caching: 1:14.36
  +caching: 1:07.83

But... I need a bigger fish to fry.

Ah, add_action!

Let's profile add_action first. Before caching add_action:

How weird. I got a crash. Signal 8 - floating point error?? Oh, sum probably got too large. Don't print the average and
see what happens.

Oh, no, oops. There are 2 add_actions and I instrumented the one that's never called. Oops. Fixt hat!

OK, here's what we get without caching on add_action

$ BL_LEVEL=fatal time ./build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db test/logs/combat_2025-04-20_19_52_15_159478.txt

So, 741.85 us/call. Now, with caching. Added caching to add_action. And here we go!

Eh, definitely diminishing returns. The timing seems odd. Consider:

Total parsing: 5.183463599s
Total populating: 64.978259834s

So, almost all the time is taken up in populating, as is to be expected.

Of the functions I've "profiled" so far, I see (with caching):

add_name_id total: 1.455509265s
add_pc_class total: .324674260s
add_action total:  2.046636890s

These are very low numbers. Where is all the time coming from?

Actors are painfully slow, too. How about them.

Without caching, I see these measurements:

Wow, these are interesting

add_pc_actor:  0.263111719s total
add_npc_actor: 9.064179454s total, 780us per call

This kinda makes sense - add_pc_actor is mostly concernted the actor's class (cached) and name/id (cached).

Let's try npc actor. That will again need two items in the key tuple - name, instance. Hmm.

OK, results from caching the add_npc_actor:

Another nice improvement, although I don't entirely understand the final number:

total:
  -add_npc_actor cache: 1:09.89
  +add_npc_actor cache: 1:05.32

populate_from_entry:

  +cache: 59.263380004s, 2.963169 ms/call

None of the other actors are worth caching - add_pc_actor is already cached and add_companion_actor is only called 21
times. How often do you have your comps out in raids? never.

That may be it for our caching improvements. They were worthwhile. Let's commit these and try a test of the measurements
without the caching.

Later - gotta practice.

2025-11-05

What would a cache abstraction look like?  Basically, there are three things that can happen in our typical situation:

1. The key is found in the cache. Return the value.
2. The key is not found in the cache. Check the database.
3. The key is found in the database. Return the value.
4. The key is not found in the database. Add key to database and return value.

Essentially, the abstraction looks like:

1. A way to check the cache.
2. A way to update the cache.
3. A way to check the database.
4. A way to insert into the database.

Kind of like a strategy pattern. The strategy is:

Check if key is in cache.
If key in cache:
    Return value
Check if key in database.
If key in database:
    Return value
Add key to database
Return value

Stuff to think about.

This is a waste of time. The database is not the important part. Move on.

Fuck the unit tests for the cache. I'm tired.

Template on key, value
class Cache
    cache holds map.

Cache add(
    key
    check database string
    params to check database query
    func to add to database
) returns V value

cache variable: template type, std::map<K,V>
key: template type, K key
 check database: string query and pqxx::params
func to add to database: lambda that does other adds (name_id, etc.)

Nope, don't care. Not doing this. Wasting my time.

I think I need to build some in-memory structures that could be used by plugins. 

2025-11-06

OK, let's do some statistics! Some obvious things:

DPS
HPS
DTPS
Instantaneous damage (over recent period)

2025-11-07

Interesting. The stats code ends up needing to have very similar functions because stats needs to maintain similar data
structures. Huh.

Hmm, does the stats class need to always exist or only at combat start? Hmm.

Maybe other classes to track party state - what area we're in, what PCs we've seen, what effects are on toons, etc.

Hmm. I kinda like that. Very simple classes. Hmm.

Let's dump all the logs into the database and do some querying. I want to see things like effects.

NOTE, here are are all of the event action nouns I see in a million or so events. Oh, no Event actions have a details
field.

 Event | AbilityActivate                     | n/a
 Event | AbilityCancel                       | n/a
 Event | AbilityDeactivate                   | n/a
 Event | AbilityInterrupt                    | n/a
 Event | Crouch                              | n/a
 Event | Death                               | n/a
 Event | EnterCombat                         | n/a
 Event | EnterCover                          | n/a
 Event | ExitCombat                          | n/a
 Event | FailedEffect                        | n/a
 Event | FallingDamage                       | n/a
 Event | LeaveCover                          | n/a
 Event | ModifyThreat                        | n/a
 Event | NoLongerSuspicious                  | n/a
 Event | Revived                             | n/a
 Event | TargetCleared                       | n/a
 Event | TargetSet                           | n/a
 Event | Taunt                               | n/a

OK, I can see that I'm starting to use some of the same information multiple places - IDs for actions, for example. I
really need to put this is a common place. Joy.

What kind of configuration db do I want?

Think I'm gonna write my own. I want something SUPER SIMPLE. INI reader. There we go.

=======
OK, working on it - implemented and now testing.

Damn, I've parsed and populated almost 8 million events. Shit.

2025-11-08

Wow, populator finally finished. Took 17 hours, lol. It parsed and populated 10M events. Wow.

Some row information:

Name: 14,104
Advanced_Class: 49
Action: 9192
PC actors: 1663
NPC actors: 37,811
Combats: 6089
Area: 138
Log_File: 344
Event: 10,256,807

So, total time was 17:04:15, or 61,455 seconds. Thus, parse/pop rows/sec is:

116.9 rows/sec

That's not terrible, actually. A quick look at the performance counters shows that populate vs parse is about 15x? So,
then the expected number of rows/sec parsed is

time to parse one row * num_rows + time to populate one row * num_rows = total time

1x * num_rows + 15x * num_rows = total time

num_rows * 16x = total_time

16x = total_time / num_rows

x = total_time / (16 * num_rows)

x = 61455s / (16 * 10256807 rows) = 0.000374 s/row = 0.374 ms/row

This is about 2800 rows/sec. That's what I'm talking about.

I did a bunch of INI stuff, but it's a waste. A damn header file will do. Just make one. Sheesh.

2025-11-09

OK, merged the new searches branch - some TODOs in there but they involve more complex queries than I know how to do yet.

Back to combat statistics.

Tracking damage done in combat. All damage seems to be registered as an "effect" via ApplyEffect, such as:

[20:03:40.877] [src] [tgt] [Rifle Assault {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Damage {836045448945501}] (5824 energy {836045448940874}) <5824.0>

There are other types of "Damage" abilities, but this appears the only way that damage is applied to actors.

I'm getting overwhelmed with all of the stats I *could* collect. For example:

Combat:
    enter/exit time
    all actors in combat

Effects:
    source
    target
    effect name/id
    activation time
    end time
    end reason (interrupt, deactivate, cancel)

Actors:
    damage done by actor
    damage received by actor
    deaths
    X previous damage received before each death
    revives
    ability activations:
        time
        ability name
        total damage done
        list of damage hits
            time
            damage
            damage type?
    self effects:

I'm still torn between producing real-time stats and post-combat analysis stats. Sheesh.

Do I want an in-memory database? A combination of in-memory database and real-time statistics?

IN-memory database. This mainly looks like an interpretation of the Event table and giving some semantic meaning to the
events. More like a rearrangement and combining some events together (apply/remove effect, etc.)

Combat:
  begin
  end
  area

CombatActors:
  type
  class
  max health

Effects:
  effect name
  applied-by ability
  source
  target
  apply time
  removal time

Abilities Used
  actor
  ability
  time
  termination reason (interupt, cancel, deactivate)

Deaths
  actor
  time
  last X events that affected actor
  last damage hit value

Revives
  actor
  time

Damage
  source
  target
  time
  ability
  base
  crit
  effective
  type (internal, elemental, kinetic, energy, none)
  avoid reason (immune, dodge, parry, miss, resist, deflect, none)
  absorbed amount
  absorbed reason (shield, none)

Damage per ability activation
  source
  target
  ability
  effective
  total
  mitigated

I'm not sure this is all right, but oh well.

Now, what about realtime statistics:

CombatActor:
  name
  pointer to actor table
  total damge dealt
  total damage received
  current dps
  current dtps
  current effects
  current health

Ooh, I think I can find unique abilities. I have a duplicate name finder - just reverse that test. Then weed out
those that aren't abilities. something like that.
  
It appears that damage actions (applyeffect: damage) always have an ability, so they look like this:

[ts] [src] [tgt] [ability] [applyeffect: damage] (val-stuff) <thread>

helpful to roll up damage into ability activations.

1. See self-ability activation. push into queue

2. See damage and note ability.

3. Go through queue and find first ability of same damage type.

4. If another self-ability activation of same type is later in queue, remove the oldest activation.

During this, if we see an ability cancel/interrupt/deactivate then remove oldest ability in queue and consider it rolled up.

Do something clever with rolled up damage.



Ability activations *always* have the same source/target. So, if Costom uses Boltstorm, there'll be an AbilityActivate
event where cosmo is the source and target that has:

Ability: Boltstorm
Action: verb=Event noun=AbilityActivate

Looking debuff effects, like grav round's "gravity vortex" or "Sundered (physical)", they're applied and then they fall
off. They AREN'T shown as reapplied if they're already active. Hmm.

Timing looks a little off, though. Let's look at grav round's sundered. It's weird:

[13:27:02.263] [Keepthefaith] [Annihilation Droid)] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Sundered (Physical) {}]

We see alternating apply/remove, which makes sense. But the times are odd. the effect duration is unpredictable, from
0.2s to 18s?? WTF?

As far as doing damage, it looks like we have this pattern:

[13:35:19.223] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]
[13:35:20.832] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Gravity Vortex {}]
[13:35:20.833] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Sundered (Physical) {}]
[13:35:20.891] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Damage {}] (base eff kinetic {}) <threat>

So, the target for the initial ability activation is the source. Then after that, all effects on the enemy will have
them as the target. The middle 2 will only show up if the target didn't already have those effects.

Note there are some strange orderings in the log. For example, using 2 grav rounds in a row sometimes shows this:

[13:35:59.934] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]
[13:36:01.136] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]
[13:36:01.441] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Sundered (Physical) {}]
[13:36:01.524] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Damage {}] (16638 kinetic {}) <16638.0>
[13:36:02.340] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]
[13:36:02.700] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Damage {}] (16083 ~16082 kinetic {}) <16083.0>
[13:36:03.539] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]
[13:36:03.876] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Damage {}] (15829 ~15830 kinetic {}) <15829.0>
[13:36:04.830] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]
[13:36:05.224] [src] [tgt] [Grav Round {}] [ApplyEffect {}: Damage {}] (26384* kinetic {}) <26384.0>
[13:36:06.038] [src] [=] [Grav Round {}] [Event {}: AbilityActivate {}]

So, over around 6s we have:

6 grav round activations: diffs: 1.2s, 1.3s, 1.2s, 1.3s, 1.2s
4 grav round damages: diffs with activation: 1.6s, 1.6s, 1.5s, 1.7s

Big question: Where do these timestamps come from? Local or server?

This log kinda sucks. Very hard to trust the times. I don't know what to believe. I wonder if other casted abilities
(abilities that activate at the end of the GCD and not at the beginning.

So, the challenge with this ...

2025-11-11

Working more on the "show unique abilities for each class" query. I ended up trying:

Make a table, "a", that has the ability ID and the class that used it

Make a table, "b", that has the ability ID and the number of distinct classes that used it

join a & b to get this:

ability, class, number of classes that use this ability

then simply only select the rows that only have 1 class using the ability and then dump the ability and class.

It's a big query, but seemed to work OK. But the results aren't quite right:

31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,13742,D-R0M Probe
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5589,Dirty Blast
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5600,Dirty Shot
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5611,Dodge Stance
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5596,Hemorrhaging Blast
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,7511,Ikas XK-13
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5767,Illegal Mods
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,1287,Major Fleet Requisition Grant
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5598,Smuggler's Chems
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,13729,Vectron TM-22 Volo
31,Gunslinger,Dirty Fighting,5599,Wounding Shots

This looks good - sorta. NO flurry of bolts?


Global to-do:

1) DONE Start pushing up to GitHub.
2) Make a container for the build environment.
3) Add CI/CD via github actions.
4) DONE Start using github for doing PRs, etc.
5) DONE Analyze gprof results
6) DONE Performance optimizations, if necessary.
7) Add another field to Combat that describes the boss. Create table of area/bosses so we can add the boss to the combat when
   we see them.
8) Investigate boost program options library - CLI11 might be interesting
9) DONE Try profiling run with simple cache and simple metrics.
10) Add tests for correct add_action. Oops.
11) NOT DOING Is it reasonable to create abstract caching that could be turned on/off?
12) NOT DOING Create issue for configuration database
13) Think about combat statistics (damage, heal, etc.)
14) Write search to show abilities that were activated by only 1 class.
