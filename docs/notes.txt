Added logic to specify how to handle populating logfiles that have already been parsed and pushed into the
database. That's kind of nice.

Added profiling via gprof to my code in the CMakeLists.txt like so:

target_compile_options(
  swtor_combat_populate_db_exe
  PRIVATE -pg
)

target_link_options(
  swtor_combat_populate_db_exe
  PRIVATE -pg
)

Now I'm running the populator (which also exercises the parser) against some logfiles. No idea what this will look
like. This will produce gmon.out.

We get an analysis via

gprof swtor_combate_populate_db_exe gmon.out > analysis.txt

Note that I tried gprofng, but it doesn't actually hack up the executable and just samples (somehow) the state of the
execution and uses that to infer timing, but that didn't seem very useful at all to me. Nice that it didn't require
recompilation and a big slow-down, but not much actual data.

To think about:

1) Start pushing up to GitHub.
2) Make a container for the build environment.
3) Add CI/CD via github actions.
4) Start using github for doing PRs, etc.
5) Analyze gprof results
6) Performance optimizations, if necessary.

OK, run finally finished. Around 330k log lines parsed and populated.

Highest cost of my calls:

DbPopulator::populate_from_entry - makes sense, this wraps all other populateion calls
DbPopulator::add_name_id - as I expected, this is the most expensive because it's called so often
    in fact, it's called 1,309,195 times for 330k entries. Wow, that's a lot. Easy to optimize via cache.
DbPopulator::add_action - not surprising, called on every single event. Easy enough to cache this, too.

Learned how to visualize using gprof2dot. Via:

gprof build/dev/swtor_combat_populate_db gmon.out | gprof2dot --strip | dot -Tpng -o gprof.png

Very handy. '--strip' gets rid of all the cruft (function params, template shit, etc.). Very nice. Basically told me the
same thing but the callgraph is nice.

Also a recommendation to use 'callgrind' from valgrind instead of gprof. Not sure how callgrind works. Maybe look that
up.

But, the result I see from here is that adding the Name and Action cache would be handy.

Bedtime.

Turns out you can have two ExitCombats in a row!

File: combat_2025-03-22_17_47_15_992759.txt

93027 and 93062

No intervening EnterCombat. Weird.

There's only 500ms or so between these lines.

It looks like it ends when I die and then it ends again when the final boss dies. Hmm.

Populator can't handle that and crashed. What should we do in that situation?

...43.720: ExitCombat
...43.805: Boss dies
...44.215: ExitCombat

Nobody died in-between or immediately. I dunno what happened. I'll log an error and ignore it.

Going to try Google's "gflags" library for command line parsing. Who knows?

Can't get it to build via FetchContent. Getting this error:

CMake Error (dev) at build/dev/_deps/gflags-src/CMakeLists.txt:430 (gflags_define):
  uninitialized variable 'LIB_SUFFIX'

Tried running ccmake in the gflags dir and 'c' for configure and then try to generate via cmake - no joy.

Had to set LIB_SUFFIX in gflag's CMakeLists.txt. Also had to update the required min version to 3.5 due to
deprecation. Sheeh. Ugh, also had to fix a floating comparison in a test I don't care about in gflags. Ugh.

Fuck, the logfile is in CP-1252 (WINDOWS-1252) encoding and the database uses UTF-8 by default. Fuck fuck.

Use SET client_encoding = WIN1252; after creating database. Oops, didn't work. Still same error.

Want entire DB to be WIN1252.

FUCK ME.

create database swtor_combat_explorer with encoding 'WIN1252' LC_COLLATE='en_US.WIN1252' LC_CTYPE='en_US.WIN1252' TEMPLATE=template0;

Didn't work.

create database swtor_combat_explorer with encoding 'WIN1252' LC_COLLATE='C' LC_CTYPE='C' TEMPLATE=template0;

This seemed to have worked.

2025-10-13

Things are apace. Almost done with the db parser. I was able to create ParsedLogLine and have it populate an Event and
all of the vairous sub-tables. Yay.

I think I should rename the advanced_class table to be more up with the current nomenclature.

Interestingly, the game and the documentation is schizophrenic. The website talks about the old "class" and "advanced
class" terms, but the game itself talks about "Combat Style" and "Discipline." And the log talks about "Discipline
Changed" and doesn't use "class/advanced class" anywhere. Joy.

I think the table should be "Class" and the attributes should be "style" and "discipline." Makes it easier to get a
handle on it, IMHO.

I also created a new table that holds an ability name and a reference to a class. The ability is intended to be a unique
ability only available to the associated class. This will allow the DB to store a PC's class even if we never see a
DisciplineChanged event, which is common in some situations, like PvP or world activities, where not everybody's grouped
up.

In addition, I want to prepopulate the Class (was Advanced_Class) table with the current style/disciplines for PCs. No
reason to populate this table from the log. Just gotta do it.

Oh, I just removed clang-tidy entirely from the build. It was so slow and I get tidy from the lsp, so not a big
deal. IT'S SO MUCH FASTER NOW.

I'm gonna try parsing an entire log soon!! Yikes!! Then I gotta work on some searches to find interesting things... heh
heh heh.

Should I add a Logfile attribute to the Event table? That way you can always relate a log entry to the logfile it came
from and vice-versa. Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I have the logfile attribute in the Combat table, but there are a
lot of log entries that fall outside of combat, and those currently can't be related to a specific logfile.

But... does that matter? I'm not sure it does. The only reason we care about logfile even now is that we can keep track
of its parsing status via the "fully_parsed" attribute. Theoretically, once a logfile is fully parsed we can just ignore
a request to parse it again and save a ton of time.

In the end, I don't think it's worth doing anything to Event. Let's leave it the way it is. Who knows if this will even
be relevant in the end.

The db populator executable needs a lot of work. I haven't touched it in over a month since I moved the population code
into its own library.

2025-10-01

OMG, I think I just got rid of clang-tidy for all time. Well, I didn't see it running in a build.  So much faster. Let's
try changing just one file.

One problem of using the language server, of course, is that it runs clang-tidy, too.

No, I still see tidy being run. AARGH. Where? Why? ::sigh::

Wait. How could I possibly reparse the same log? How I would I know lines had been parsed and populated and which
hadn't? I'd have to search every line for the same timestamp and some other unique combination of attributes to see if
it existed. If this doesn't work right, I'd end up repopulating the entire file again, essentially blowing up the Event
table with duplicated garbage. Ugh.

OK, that's a problem for another time. But it will need to be solved. Easiest way seems to be by adding a logfile
attribute to Event. Then when a reparse was requested, we'd just blow everything, all events and combats and combat
actors related to that logfile and then reparse from scratch. I like that.

Dammit, so many things to do. :/

2025-09-27

OK, spend some time to avoid running clang-tidy all over again.



2025-09-26

One possibility - We could flatten the text event into a single csv row with empty fields. Make it super easy to
parse. Like an intermediate representation. Another output like the database. Advantage: easier to read. Disadvantage -
more code to maintain. Advantage - other programs could work with this text more easily than interacting with the
database, which requires Postgres, blah blh blah. Disadvantage: reading csv might be slower and client would still have
to keep track of actors. But not a huge deal.

Wouldn't depend on a library, either, could do all csv parsing by hand since no string in the log can ever contain a
comma. Hmm.

2025-09-22

Car problems worked out, yay. A lot (lot lot) of time on add PC Actor function and its tests. I feel like I'm
overthinking this and that's why it's so complicated. Every log seems to start with

AreaEntered
DisciplineChanged

So, it's only for the first line that I won't know the class. You can't change class during combat so all I really need
to handle is remembering the actor row id of the last time I saw the pc. When combat starts I could even just search for
the most recent actor row that has the PC's name. Easy enough.

I'm seriously making this more complicated than it needs to be. :/ I'm pretty sure that all I need to remember is the
most recent actor row ID of the actor's name. But... maybe not. It looks like the logs DO have instances where the first
thing I see of a PC is NOT their class. :/ Rats!!

So I think I'll keep it simpl and use m_pcs and just update it when a new row is created in Actor.

2025-09-13

Stupid car problems, choir party - yesterday was fun, actually. No programming though. Today I'm back at it. Finished
add_pc_class and writing the test. Getting a weird error:

unknown file: Failure
C++ exception with description "ERROR:  input of anonymous composite types is not implemented
CONTEXT:  unnamed portal parameter $2 = '...'
" thrown in the test body.

After finding it and wrapping with a catch and rethrowing, I see this:

OOPS1
ERROR:  input of anonymous composite types is not implemented
CONTEXT:  unnamed portal parameter $2 = '...'

SELECT id FROM Advanced_class WHERE (style, advanced_class) = ($1, $2)
unknown file: Failure
C++ exception with description "ERROR:  input of anonymous composite types is not implemented
CONTEXT:  unnamed portal parameter $2 = '...'
" thrown in the test body.

2025-09-10

Making good progress, but slowed by my stupid car problems. :/

2025-09-06

OK, finally getting on a roll. I think I have a better handle on pqxx and PostgreSql.

NOTE: Don't try to insert a value into a SERIAL field. I don't think the database knows to update the "get next value"
so eventually i think we get a clash.

I'm actually finding bugs with these tests, yay yay yay.



2025-09-04

Yeah, lots of time has gone by. Getting more familiar with pqxx, lots of of learning and failing. :/

IMPORTANT: In SELECT statements, DON'T surround the result column list in '()'! This causes pqxx to NOT PARSE THE
RESULT. So, you just get a single column back and it's only useful as null-terminated string. Ugh, that cost me days of
pain.

Turns out more info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55320143/do-you-need-surrounding-parantheses-in-postgres-select-statement

So, if you put the parens in there, you're indicating you want a composite value value in a single column. The parens
form a "row constructor or "composite value." I was getting back a row with one column of a "row" type. I had no idea
had to deal with that.

After futzing around

2025-08-23

pqxx::work is just an alias for pqxx::transaction<>. Too bad that's not documented anywhere.

2025-08-17

Brahms was awesome.

Time to add pg to the CMake file and create a new executable to interact with pg and the parser library.

Tryuing to use libpqxx, a C++ API that sits on top of libpq, the standard C-client interface. Not working,
however. Installed libpqxx-dev and libpq-dev and then modified CMake per suggestion.

However, doesn't work because because libpqxx looks for std::source_location for some reason but c++20 doesn't have it -
my code is c++20. So, gonna switch over to fetchcontent.

OK, got it going. Looking good. Runs and I can connect to the DB. Let's see if I can query the version table, which
should have a row.

Got it! It works! Yay.



2025-08-16

Brahms day! But a few database things as well. Probably should use the
environment variables for connecting/authenticating to the database.

PGDATABASE=swtor_combat_explorer
PGUSER=jason
PGPASSWORD=jason

Gotta get ready.

2025-08-15

After doing some futzing, I was able to populate the database with my
tables. Now I should try writing some code that uses the parser and
populates the tables themselves.

Fun!

Seems like I need another program, a 'populator' that uses the parser.

OK, cool.

Wait, I think I should put a version number into the database. That
way I can (theoretically) allow the client code to require a version
and to warn users if the database is old. I could also (theoretically)
embed information on how to migrate between versions?

2025-08-14

OK, so how do I do this?

Trying to 'createdb' (per Postgres documentation), but getting an
error:

$ createdb: error: database creation failed: ERROR:  permission denied to create database

The tutorial indicates that I need to log into the account that's
associated with the postgres server. Can't seem to do that. I found a
user named 'postgres', but I don't know the password!

$ su postgres
Password: 
su: Authentication failure

Tried my favorite and some other obvious ones, like:

admin
administrator
postgres
postgresql
jason

I think I installed it as part of the SQL class, but I can't remember
much about that. Let's go look.

Huh, the notes from the postgres class look like this:

$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

Start the service running:

$ sudo systemctl start postgresql.service

Become the postgres user to avoid having to authenticate with the
database as the superuser:

$ sudo -i -u postgres

Access the command-line client:

$ psql

Now I can make my user and database:

CREATE USER jason WITH PASSWORD 'jason';
CREATE DATABASE people WITH OWNER 'jason';

Now get out of sudo and connect directly:

$ psql people jason
psql (16.3 (Ubuntu 16.3-0ubuntu0.24.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

people=>

OK, that all seems reasonable. However, I'm guessing in order to use
createdb I'll have to specify my user name somehow. Let's see.

Yeah, createdb can specify the username:

-U, --username  user name to connect as
-W, --password  force password prompt

$ createdb -WU jason
Password: (entered jason)
createdb: error: database creation failed: ERROR:  permission denied to create database

So, still no joy. Let's try the suggestion from the class:

$ sudo -i -u postgres
[sudo] password for jason: 
postgres@jason-ThinkPad-T580:~$ 

OK, so now I'm the postgres user.

postgres@jason-ThinkPad-T580:~$ psql
psql (16.9 (Ubuntu 16.9-0ubuntu0.24.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# SELECT * from USER;
   user   
----------
 postgres
(1 row)

There's no 'jason' user like I expected? I wonder if I didn't actually
do that.

postgres=# CREATE USER jason WITH PASSWORD 'jason';
ERROR:  role "jason" already exists

Huh. So, it's a role and not in the USER table?

Ah, there's a super-secret command that I found via:

postgres=# \?

\dg shows the roles

                             List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes                         
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------
 jason     | 
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS

Huh. Notice that 'jason' doesn't have any attributes, so it literally
can't create databases. Ah-ha!

Per the web:

postgres=# ALTER ROLE jason WITH CREATEDB;
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# \dg
                             List of roles
 Role name |                         Attributes                         
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------
 jason     | Create DB
 postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS

 Excellent. Trying via createdb again.

$ createdb -WU jason
Password:
$

No erros this time. Excellent.

$ createdb -WU jason swtor_combat_explorer
Password:
$

Ooh.

$ pg_dump -WU jason

jason=> 

Looks good. Now, how do I set the current database?

jason=> \c swtor_combat_explorer
You are now connected to database "swtor_combat_explorer" as user "jason".
swtor_combat_explorer=> 

OK, sweet. Notice that "database" and "schema" seemed to be used
interchangably. Now let's create our first table!

swtor_combat_explorer=> CREATE TABLE Name (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR (128),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
swtor_combat_explorer->

Seemed to work. Actually, I hadn't finished the command yet! See the
prompt went from => to -> (equals to dash). This means that I haven't
completed the command. Let's try again.

swtor_combat_explorer=> CREATE TABLE Name (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR (128),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE
swtor_combat_explorer=>

Better.

swtor_combat_explorer=> \dt
       List of relations
 Schema | Name | Type  | Owner

swtor_combat_explorer=> 

OK, I like it. How do I show the schema of a table?

Note that Postgres doesn't seem to preserve capitalization - the
relation is "name" not "Name" like I entered. Hmm.

swtor_combat_explorer=> \d name
                       Table "public.name"

swtor_combat_explorer=> 

So, this just relates a numeric ID to a string. ez-pz.

Next table.

swtor_combat_explorer=> CREATE TABLE Combat_Style (
  id SERIAL,
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);
CREATE TABLE
swtor_combat_explorer=>

And how does it look?

swtor_combat_explorer=> \d combat_style
                            Table "public.combat_style"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable |                 Default

Indexes:
    "combat_style_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "combat_style_name_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES name(id)

swtor_combat_explorer=>

Nice. The 'nextval' stuff is the internal junk that implements a
monotonically-increasing sequence suitable for an identifier (SERIAL).



2025-08-13

OK, I think the parsing task is pretty much done. I can go through
hundreds of logs with gigabytes of data and not encounter a single
parsing failure. Of course, I've also given up on some of the
higher-level semantic extraction I was trying to embed. No matter,
probably better left to client code anyway.

Now I want to think about how to store this data in a database. Need
to think about tables and fields now. Joy. SQL. Suck.

Obvious tables:

CREATE TABLE Version (
  id INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  creation TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- All of the names we've seen so far
--
-- This is an optimization to avoid storing strings in multiple tables.
-- The 'id' field is directly from the input log entry and is guaranteed
-- unique but is essentially a GUID.
CREATE TABLE Name (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR (128),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Because the Name primary key is a BIGINT, all FKs to it must also
-- be FKs.

-- These little tables that are really just FKs into Name are giving
-- semantic meaning to the Name. We could also add an enumeration column
-- to Name indicating the context for Name. I'm not sure if that's a
-- better idea. But, the enumeration does mean I'd have to update the
-- enumeration each time I wanted to add a new category of meaning,
-- whereas this just requires adding a table. Hmm.
CREATE TABLE Combat_Style (
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (name),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Advanced_Class (
  id SERIAL,
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  style INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (style) REFERENCES Combat_Style(name)
);

CREATE TABLE Actor (
  id SERIAL,
  name BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

-- Because PC's can change their class, we need another identifier to
-- refer to the specific style/class used in a combat.

-- NOTE: Initially I thought I could use the inherited 'id' column from
-- Actor to be the primary key, but I had to list the 'id' directly in
-- 'PC' to allow me to refer to it from Companion. Postgres says this:
--
-- NOTICE:  merging column "id" with inherited definition
CREATE TABLE PC (
  id SERIAL,
  class INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (class) REFERENCES Advanced_Class(id)
) INHERITS (Actor);

CREATE TABLE Companion (
  id SERIAL,
  pc INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (pc) REFERENCES PC(id)
) INHERITS (Actor);

CREATE TABLE NPC (
  id SERIAL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) INHERITS (Actor);

CREATE TABLE Area (
--  id SERIAL,
  area INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (area),
  FOREIGN KEY (area) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Log_File (
  id SERIAL,
  filename VARCHAR(512),
  ts BIGINT NOT NULL, -- timestamp, ms past the epoch
  fully_parsed BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE Combat (
  id SERIAL,
  -- timestamps (ts_*) are stored as ms past the epoch
  ts_begin BIGINT NOT NULL,
  ts_end BIGINT NOT NULL,
  area INT NOT NULL,
  logfile INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (area) REFERENCES Area(area),
  FOREIGN KEY (logfile) REFERENCES Log_File(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Combat_Actor (
  combat INT NOT NULL,
  actor INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (combat, actor),
  FOREIGN KEY (combat) REFERENCES Combat(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (actor) REFERENCES Actor(id)
);

CREATE TYPE Location AS (
  x FLOAT,
  y FLOAT,
  z FLOAT,
  rot FLOAT
);

CREATE TYPE Health AS (
  current INT,
  maximum INT
);

CREATE TABLE Event (
  id SERIAL,
  ts BIGINT NOT NULL, -- ms since epoch
  source INT,
  source_location Location,
  source_health Health,
  target INT,
  target_location Location,
  target_health Health,
  ability INT,
  action_noun INT NOT NULL,
  action_verb INT NOT NULL,
  action_details INT,
  value_version VARCHAR(16),
  value_base INT,
  value_crit BOOL,
  value_effective INT,
  value_type INT,
  value_mitigation_reason INT,
  value_mitigation_effect_value INT,
  value_mitigation_effect_value_name INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (source) REFERENCES Actor(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (target) REFERENCES Actor(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (ability) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (action_noun) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (action_verb) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (action_details) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_type) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_mitigation_reason) REFERENCES Name(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (value_mitigation_effect_value_name) REFERENCES Name(id)
);

This seems like a reasonable first approximation. I'm not sure how to
exactly use the Actor hierarchy, but the inheritance hierarchy matches
how I think about it.

Gotta work on creating the database in Postgres and then try parsing
and inserting rows. Querying... that's something else. :)

2025-08-02

I think the value field needs to be parsed very differently. Rather
than trying to impose meaning on the whole field, I should think about
the field as subfields, like source/target. I think the value looks
something like this, ALL of which are optional except for the base_value

block 1: applied values: base_value crit '~' eff_value
block 2: damage type: name {id}
block 3: mitigation ability: -name {id}
block 4: mitigation/reflection: '(' INT name {id} ')'

Due to bugs and other issues that I can't possibly fathom, blocks 2-4
have weird formats:

block 2: 'name' might be empty (missing), leaving only {id}

block 3: This might only be '-'

block 4: Either INT or 'name {id}' might be missing

Seems like I can find these blocks relatively easily:

block 1: Always present, find '~' for eff value

block 2: First character past block 1 is not '-' and not '('

block 3: Next character is '-'

block 4: Has '()' delimiters

Fuck me. If I go this route, it means:

1. I give up imposing much semantic meaning on these values. In other
   words, I give up trying to do much interpretation and become more
   dumb.
2. I have to ditch all of the Value types and just keep LogInfo and
   some other type that represents this bizarre union.
3. Rewrite tests, etc. Ugh.

Lunch.

First, let's review my fatal parses.

OK, all are either source or value. Makes sense - value is the only
truly complicated field and I've been f'ing around with the source
parsing. ::sigh::

There is a fatal parse error in a target! Let's find that.

Shit, the parsed file is so huge that I can't really work with
it. Need to write a python script to parse the timestamp and then
search assumiming it's sorted. :/

Even wc -l takes f'ing forever.

960,064,170

That's a lot of lines. Almost a million lilnes. Better do it in C++.

I feel like learning some coroutines so I can easily read from a file
in a for-each loop. This requires me to learn more of the
library. But, hey, why not? I have the time!

'co_return': Produce return value of a coro when the coroutine ends.

'co_await': suspend a co_routine until an await'ed condition is
satisfied.

'co_yield': produce a value to the caller and suspend.

"coroutine handle": pointer to coroutine state to continue or destroy.

"promise type": user-defined type that defines the return object of
the coroutine, the logic for handling suspension and resumption, and
how to handle exceptions.

"awaiter": An object that defines how to handle 'co_await' - must
implement await_ready(), await_suspend(), and await_resume().

Lifecycle:

- Creation: When coroutine function is first called, creates coroutine
  frame holding coroutine state.
- Initial suspension: At creation, coroutine starts but the promise
  type can tell it to immediately suspend before the first execution.
- Execution: coroutine executes user code until it encounters
  co_await, co_yield, or co_return.
- Suspension: Use awaiter's logic to determine how to suspend when
  code executes co_await or co_yield.
- Resumption: Coroutine can be resumed until another co_wait or
  co_yield is encountered.
- Final suspension: After the coroutine has completed, the promise
  determines if it should suspend again.
- Destruction: Coroutine frame is destroyed and releases all resources.

Simple example:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
#include <chrono>
#include <coroutine>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <thread>

struct simple_awaiter {
    std::chrono::milliseconds delay;

    auto await_ready() const noexcept -> bool {
	// Handles the case where the user wants no delay.
	return delay.count() <= 0;
    }

    auto await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<> handle) const -> void {
	std::thread([handle, this] {
	    // Simulate waiting for some event
	    std::this_thread::sleep_for(delay);
	    // Resume the coroutine after the delay
	    handle.resume();
	}).detach(); 
    }

    auto await_resume() const noexcept -> void {
	// Simply continue execution
    }
};

struct task {
    struct promise_type {
	auto get_return_object() -> task {
	    return {std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(*this)};
	}
	auto initial_suspend() -> std::suspend_never {
	    return {};
	}
	auto final_suspend() noexcept -> std::suspend_never {
	    return {};
	}
	auto return_void() -> void {
	}
	auto unhandled_exception() -> void {
	}
    };

    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> m_handle;
};

auto async_wait(std::chrono::milliseconds delay) ->task {
    std::cout << "Coroutine is about to suspend for " << delay.count() << "ms." << std::endl;
    co_await simple_awaiter {delay};
    std::cout << "Coroutine has resumed." << std::endl;
    co_return;
}

// Use 'endl' to force flushing.
auto main() -> int {
    std::cout << "main start---->" << std::endl;
    auto task = async_wait(std::chrono::seconds(5));
    std::cout << "main continues." << std::endl;
    // Ensure the coroutine has resumed: > 5s
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(7));
    std::cout << "main end <----\n";
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the cppreference:

Coroutine is a function that can suspend and resume without a stack -
they use a heap allocation to act as an execution frame. A coroutine
may contain the following keywords:

co_await: suspend execution until resumed

co_yield: suspend execution and yield a value to caller

co_return: complete execution and return value

Note that a coroutine must use co_return AND NOT return.

A coroutine shouldn't fall off the end (return void implicitly) - UB.

The 'main' function can't be a coroutine.

A coroutine is associated with:

- the COROUTINE PROMISE object: this is manipulated INSIDE the
  coroutine.  The coroutine submits its result (or an exception)
  through the promise object. This has nothing to do with
  std::promise.
- the COROUTINE HANDLE: this is manipulated OUTISDE the coroutine. A
  non-owning handle, this is used to resume execution of the coroutine
  or destroy the coroutine frame.
- the COROUTINE STATE: this is internal, dynamically-allocated
  storage. It contains:
  - the COROUTINE PROMISE object
  - the PARAMETERS passed by the caller to the coroutine - always
    copied by value.
  - some representation of the CURRENT SUSPENSION POINT (a co_yield
    statement) so that the coroutine can resume execution or know
    which locals are in scope.
  - LOCAL VARIABLES that are active at the suspension point - their
    lifetime spans the suspension point

The coroutine state is basically an execution frame that's implemented
using the heap rather than the stack. This allows the coroutine's
execution to transcend the stack and have a lifetime past the single
execution of a function.

When a coroutine BEGINS execution, it performs these steps:

1. ALLOCATES the COROUTINE STATE OBJECT (execution frame) using
   operator new. NOTE: The dynamic allocation can be avoided in
   certain conditions, see below.
2. COPIES all FUNCTION PARAMETERS into the coroutine state. Note that
   ref parameters will be references in the coroutine state (not
   copies), meaning the references can dangle because the coroutine's
   lifespan may be longer than the variable referenced by the
   parameter... OOPS.
3. Calls the CONSTRUCTOR of the PROMISE OBJECT. The promise object's
   constructor can take the same arguments as the coroutine
   parameters OR it can be the default constructor.
4. Calls PROMISE.GET_RETURN_OBJECT() and stores result in a local
   variable. This will be returned to the caller when the coroutine
   suspends for the first time. Stuff about exceptions...
5. Calls PROMISE.INITIAL_SUSPEND() and CO_AWAITs for its
   result. Typical coroutine Promise types either return
   std::suspend_always if they want to be "lazy," meaning they just
   prepare now but do no work until some later time; or, they can
   return std::suspend_never, meaning they are eager and want to
   immediately begin running now.
6. When CO_AWAIT PROMISE.INITIAL_SUSPEND() resumes, start executing
   the body of the coroutine.

When a coroutine REACHES A SUSPENSION POINT (co_yield?), the return
object (created by PROMISE.GET_RETURN_OBJECT() when a coroutine
starts) is returned to the user after any implicit conversion to the
coroutine's return type.

When a coroutine REACHES CO_RETURN (the end of the coroutine), the
following happens:

1. Calls PROMISE.RETURN_VOID() for a NAKED CO_RETURN or co_return
   expression that is void.
2. Calls PROMISE.RETURN_VALUE() for a CO_RETURN that has a non-void
   expression.
3. DESTROYS ALL VARIABLES with automatic storage duration IN REVERSE
   ORDER.
4. Calls PROMISE.FINAL_SUSPEND() and CO_AWAITs the result

Stuff about exceptions.

The COROUTINE STATE can be destroyed because:

- the coroutine terminates via CO_RETURN
- the coroutine terminates because the CALLER DESTROYED IT using the
  COROUTINE HANDLE
- an UNHANDLED EXCEPTION occured in the coroutine function

When the coroutine state is destroyed, it does:

1. calls the PROMISE OBJECT'S DESTRUCTOR
2. calls the DESTRUCTORS of each of the COROUTINE FUNCTION'S PARAMETERS
3. calls OPERATOR DELETE to clean up the COROUTINE'S STATE
4. transfers execution back to the caller

The COROUTINE FUNCTION can be either a FREE FUNCTION or a MEMBER FUNCTION.

For a FREE FUNCTION as the coroutine function, the COROUTINE type is

task<void> foo(int x);

then it's PROMISE type will be

std::coroutine_traits<task<void>, int>::promise_type;

For a MEMBER FUNCTION as the coroutine function, the COROUTINE type
is

task<void> Bar::foo(int x);

then its PROMISE type will be

std::coroutine_traits<task<void>, Bar&, int>::promise_type;

* CO_AWAIT <expr>

The unary operator CO_AWAIT suspends the coroutine and returns control
to the caller.

1. The expression is converted to an AWAITABLE. The awaitable can
   either be the result of the expression OR, if the PROMISE type has
   a member function named AWAIT_TRANSFORM, then the awaitable object
   is produced by calling PROMISE.AWAIT_TRANSFORM(EXPR).
2. The AWAITER object is obtained by:
   - If there is a CO_AWAIT() operator function that's the best match,
     then use either the free function OPERATOR CO_AWAIT or the member
     function on the AWAITABLE object, AWAITABLE.OPERATOR CO_AWAIT()
     and use the return as the AWAITER object.
   - Otherwise, the AWAITER and the AWAITABLE are the same.
3. AWAITER.AWAIT_READY() is called, which allows the coroutine to
   either immdiately run if the return is true or suspend if the
   return is false. This allows the coroutine to avoid an unnecessary
   suspension if it can produce the result immediately.

If awaiter.await_ready() returns false, this tells the coroutine to
suspend and the following happens:

1. The COROUTINE STATE IS POPULATED with coroutine's active local
   variables and what's required to restart at the current suspension
   point.
2. AWAITER.AWAIT_SUSPEND(HANDLE) is called where HANDLE represents the
   current coroutine. await_suspend() can examine the coroutine state
   via handle. await_suspend() is RESPONSIBLE to SCHEDULE RESUMPTION
   via some executo. AWAIT_SUSPEND can return either VOID or BOOL.
3. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() returns VOID, then the coroutine remains
   suspended and control immediately returns to the caller.
4. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() returns BOOL, if:
   - TRUE: return control to the caller/resumer of the current coroutine.
   - FALSE: resume the current coroutine
5. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() returns a COROUTINE HANDLE for a DIFFERENT
   COROUTINE, that coroutine is resumed via HANDLE.RESUME().
6. If AWAIT_SUSPEND() THROWS an exception...
7. AWAITER.AWAIT_RESUME() is called (whether or not the coroutine is
   actually suspended). awaiter.await_resume()'s return value is the
   value of the co_await expression.

NOTES:

Examples look like the coroutine returns a coroutine handle to the
caller. God, I don't understand this.

* CO_YIELD:

CO_YIELD <expr> returns the result of 'expr' to the caller and then
suspends the current coroutine. It is "the common building block of
resumable generator functions."

co_yield expr;

is equivalent to

co_await promise.yield_value(expr);

Huh.

A typical generator's YIELD_VALUE stores its argument into the
generator object and return std::suspend_always, causing the coroutine
to suspend and return control to the caller/resumer.

The dox say nothing about co_return. Hmm.

So, if I want to create a generator for reading a file, such that is
looks like this:

y = std::ifstream(file);
x = coro(y);

for (auto line : x) {
    // do something with 'line'
}

How would I go about that?

Huh, cppreference coroutine_handle has an example!

Sweet, I used the example in cppreference with a little function of my
own to make a file reader that works in a range for loop. Nice.
